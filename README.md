This project includes a simple end-to-end (E2E) test suite created using **Cypress**.  
The tests simulate real user interactions in the browser and verify key workflows, such as adding roommates and submitting expenses.

The testing environment uses a mix of **JavaScript** and **HTML** for building the UI and test scenarios.  
Cypress was chosen for its ease of use and strong support for modern web applications.

These tests were written as part of my learning process and demonstrate my understanding of basic test automation for frontend applications.
